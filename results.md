Question: What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Time Taken: 48.73 seconds
Response: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines large language models (LLMs) and vector stores to enhance information retrieval and generation processes. It involves using a retriever to find relevant information from a vector store and then leveraging an LLM to generate an output based on the retrieved data and a prompt. RAG has gained attention for its ability to expand the capabilities of information retrieval systems.
